# Inventory Optimization Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression Method)
An exercise to make a machine learning model about inventory optimization with multi linear regression method.
The purpose of this machine learning model is to predict the inventory waste values & make recommendations/suggestions based on affecting factors of the machine learning model to optimize inventory & reducing waste values in the coffee shop (capstone project). In this work I have multiple objectives to be achieved:

1. Perform Inventory Analysis

2. Build Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression Method)

3. Give Feedback Recommendation/Suggestion
